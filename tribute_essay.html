<p>The Bronx is the northernmost of the five boroughs of New York City. It is south of Westchester county, northeast and east of Manhattan, across the Harlem River; and north of Queens, across the East River.</p>

<p>Bronx County was the last of the 62 counties of New York State to be incorporated. Although the Bronx is the third most densely populated county in the United States, about a quarter of its area is open space, including Woodlawn Cemetery, Van Cortland Park, Pelham Bay Park, the New York Botanical Garden and the Bronx Zoo.</p>

<p>The name "Bronx" originated with Jonas Bronck who established the first settlement in the area as part of the New Netherland colony in 1639. The native Lenape were displaced after 1643 by settlers. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the Bronx received many immigrant and migrant groups as it was transformed into an urban community.</p>

<p>Several colleges and universities are located in the Bronx. Fordham University,  Hostos Community College, Bronx Community College and Herbert H. Lehman College, The College of Mount Saint Vincent, Manhattan College, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and two colleges based in Westchester County have Bronx campuses: College of New Rochelle and Mercy College. The State University of New York Maritime College in Fort Schuyler is the national leader in maritime education and houses the Maritime Industry Museum.</p>

<p>The Bronx county is home to the New York Yankees, to the Bronx zoo, to  the botanical garden, to the New York City FC, to the largest cooperative housing development in the world and to  Shorakkopoch Rock.</p>
